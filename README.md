# 🎨 Day 18 – Python Turtle GUI Projects 🐢

Welcome to **Day 18** of my #100DaysOfCode Python Challenge!  
This day was all about creativity, GUI, and visualizing logic using the amazing `turtle` module in Python.


## 🚀 Projects I built:

### 🟡 1. Dashed Line
A simple turtle-based pattern using movement and pen-up/pen-down logic.

### 🔷 2. Drawing Different Shapes
Created multiple polygons (triangle to decagon) using loops.

### 🎲 3. Random Walk
Turtle walks randomly on screen with random colors and directions!

### 🌀 4. Spirograph
A mesmerizing spiral design using rotational logic and RGB colors.

### 🎨 Mini Project – Hirst Dot Painting
Inspired by the artist Hirst, generated a dot painting using loops and random colors.

### ⚡ Main Project – PWM Signal Visualizer
Visualizes Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals by drawing square waves based on a user-defined **duty cycle**.


## 🛠️ What I learned:
- Turtle graphics basics
- Installing packages & importing modules with aliases
- Python tuples
- Random RGB color generation
- GUI + logic blending in fun projects
